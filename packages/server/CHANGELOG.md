### Patch Changes

- [#135](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/135) [`4f850d9`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/4f850d9bc0a05d6256c59c5117b010336fcb41d3) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - Server / client / periphery correctness (audit 2026-07-04 Wave B, cluster B6).

  - periphery-01: `POST /v1/workflows/:id/resume` actually resumes - it background-iterates `workflow.resume(threadId, {resume})` and emits every event on the `workflow:<id>/runs/<runId>/events` subject (mirroring execute); the fictional unmounted SSE URL is gone and the run completes. `POST /v1/workflows/:id/fork` returns an honest 501 instead of a 202 that forked nothing.
  - periphery-02: `standalone-server.md` now states plainly that `graphorin start` serves health/metrics/tokens/tickets/WS-SSE only and that the domain routes mount only when adapters are composed programmatically via `createServer({...})`.
  - periphery-03: the client SSE fallback survives reconnects - `#reconnect` no longer attempts the RPC resubscribe on the read-only SSE transport (which threw and permanently killed the subscription); the reconnect carries the subscription's cursor as a `Last-Event-ID` header so the server replays only missed events; a closed bound subscription is recreated on the next `subscribe()`.
  - periphery-08: the idempotency middleware tracks in-flight keyed executions - a concurrent duplicate gets `409 idempotency-in-flight` + `Retry-After` instead of double-executing (per draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header).
  - periphery-09: `subscribe({ target: 'run' })` without `sessionId` throws a clear client-side error instead of building a `run:` subject the server grammar can never accept.
  - periphery-10: session-stream subjects gate on `sessions:read:<sessionId>` (read-only streams, sessionId resource slot) instead of `agents:invoke:<sessionId>`, aligning with the SSE route's requirement.
  - periphery-11: interval triggers under `catchupPolicy: 'none'` advance to the next FUTURE boundary after downtime instead of firing immediately on restart; `recordActivity()` no longer arms idle timers on a stopped scheduler (P-14).
  - periphery-05: the TransformersJS embedder throws for an unknown model with no `dim` hint (the PS-11 fix ported from the Ollama embedder) instead of assuming 768 - a wrong assumed width baked a wrong-width id + vec0 table and the id changed after the first embed; a width drift against a bound dim now throws too.
  - P-05: the WS upgrade bearer verification passes the client IP so the per-IP failure lockout engages for upgrade attempts (previously a lockout-free brute-force surface).
  - Docs: the fictional "disconnect policy" section replaced with the real reconnect-and-replay behaviour; the WS ticket endpoint path corrected to `/v1/session/ws-ticket`.

- [#138](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/138) [`6293a25`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/6293a2531c5c9265294da22fb365a08f2bdf445a) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - Release-pipeline and tarball-surface fixes (audit 2026-07-04 Wave E, cluster E2). `@graphorin/memory`'s `./conflict` subpath was runtime-EMPTY on npm 0.5.0 (`export { };` - preserveModules emitted the module without an explicit tsdown entry); it now ships all 8 runtime exports. `@graphorin/server`'s internal `workspace:*` peer dependencies are ranged (`workspace:>=0.5.0 <1.0.0`) so changesets stops escalating every sibling bump into a bogus MAJOR for the whole fixed group (the 1.0.0 landmine on the release bot's branch). `@graphorin/eslint-plugin` gains the `./package.json` self-export. All 27 per-package CHANGELOGs gain the 0.5.0 section (they were frozen at 0.1.0 inside every published tarball), and the `mvp-readiness` release gate now rejects a stale-CHANGELOG or unresolvable-exports release.

## 0.5.0

First version published to the npm registry (with Sigstore build
provenance). The 0.2.0, 0.3.0, and 0.4.0 versions were internal lockstep
milestones and were never published. All `@graphorin/*` packages release
lockstep at the same version; the full release notes for 0.2.0-0.5.0 live
in the repository-level
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## 0.1.0

Initial release. See the workspace root `CHANGELOG.md` for the full
release notes; the per-package changelog is generated by Changesets
and tracks subsequent updates.
