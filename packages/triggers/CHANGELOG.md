Two runtime strings also dropped their ticket ids: the tools executor's approval-rewrite refusal message and the server's secret-resolution hint. A new `check-api-wording` gate scans the generated API reference and fails CI if ticket vocabulary ever leaks back in.

- [#187](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/187) [`15e65b2`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/15e65b224ebe1170d6f840ea8af393609514e051) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - Fix disabled triggers still firing via `emit()` / manual `fire()` (e2e 2026-07-16, TRIGGERS-01, minor). `fire()` honoured only the expiry check, not the persisted `disabled` flag, and `emit()` delegates to `fire()` - so an event trigger could not actually be paused (only the timer loop skipped disabled rows). `fire()` now short-circuits on every path when the trigger is disabled, checked against an in-memory `#disabled` mirror kept in sync at register / start / setDisabled / auto-pause / unregister (a per-fire `store.get()` would add latency to the hot path and reorder event emission). Regression test pins that a `setDisabled(true)` trigger fires on neither `emit()` nor `fire()`, and resumes after re-enabling.

- [#170](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/170) [`24241a3`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/24241a3cdb9c684338f02d4d66510c248eb47d7e) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - Triggers hardening (W-123 + W-124). Scheduler: persisted rows without a re-registered declaration are surfaced at `start()` with a WARN and a new `orphaned` scheduler event instead of being skipped silently, and `Scheduler.orphans()` lists them; register-time catch-up is deferred to `start()` so user callbacks never fire on a not-started scheduler. Cron: new `timezone` option (IANA, validated eagerly) evaluates the expression against the zone's wall clock with Vixie DST semantics - fixed-time jobs swallowed by a spring-forward gap run once immediately after the transition and fall-back repeats run only on the first pass, while wildcard minute/hour jobs follow the new wall clock without compensation; `isValidTimeZone` is exported. Server: `POST /v1/triggers/prune` accepts `{ disabled?: boolean = true, orphaned?: boolean = false }` and reports per-bucket removals; the triggers daemon status gains an `orphaned` count.

Without `limits` the scheduler behaves exactly as before.

### Minor Changes

- [#154](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/154) [`fe98522`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/fe98522ce2477c9a7dc09029f9dcfdb1f7c9aa04) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - W-072: every export map's `import` condition becomes `default`, and the Node floor rises to `>=22.12.0`.

  CJS consumers previously hit a bewildering `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` instead of a clear ESM-only signal. With the `default` condition, plain `require('@graphorin/core')` works via Node's stable `require(esm)` - which shipped in 22.12, hence the engines bump across every workspace manifest (packages, examples, benchmarks, docs; enforced by the widened mvp-readiness sweep). No dual-instance hazard: there is no CJS build, `require()` returns the same ESM module instance. ESM consumers are unaffected (`default` serves both paths; `types` stays first). The pack gate now runs attw under the full `node16` profile (was `esm-only`) and adds a runtime `require(esm)` smoke against the packed tarballs. Installs on Node 22.0-22.11 with `engine-strict` will refuse - upgrade Node (see the migration guide).

### Patch Changes

- [#164](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/164) [`764239b`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/764239b97e0e0202442e91272583f13adeb12d00) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - Tarballs now ship `src/` so the published `dist/**/*.d.ts.map` files actually work (W-136): the maps referenced `../src/*.ts` that the `files` whitelist excluded, so go-to-definition fell back into `.d.ts` and the shipped maps were dead weight. The pack gate gains a `map-integrity` leg: every source referenced by a shipped map must resolve inside the tarball (or be embedded via `sourcesContent`), with an anti-vacuous guard - a package whose tsdown config emits declaration maps must contain a non-zero number of `.d.ts.map` files, so a cache-restored dist that silently dropped maps fails the gate instead of passing vacuously. `mvp-readiness` now requires `src` in every publishable `files` array.

- [#164](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/164) [`764239b`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/764239b97e0e0202442e91272583f13adeb12d00) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - Every published package now declares its tree-shaking contract via `sideEffects` (W-137): 18 packages audited to a pure module scope get `false`, the CLI declares its bin entry (`["./dist/bin/*"]`), and `@graphorin/security` gets an explicit `true` - its secrets subsystem registers built-in resolvers and the SecretValue caller-context provider at import time, so marking it pure would let bundlers drop those registrations. `mvp-readiness` now fails any publishable manifest without a declared `sideEffects`, closing the drift for future packages.

No behavioral change at the current version: the rendered strings are byte-identical.

- [#135](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/135) [`4f850d9`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/4f850d9bc0a05d6256c59c5117b010336fcb41d3) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - Server / client / periphery correctness (audit 2026-07-04 Wave B, cluster B6).

  - periphery-01: `POST /v1/workflows/:id/resume` actually resumes - it background-iterates `workflow.resume(threadId, {resume})` and emits every event on the `workflow:<id>/runs/<runId>/events` subject (mirroring execute); the fictional unmounted SSE URL is gone and the run completes. `POST /v1/workflows/:id/fork` returns an honest 501 instead of a 202 that forked nothing.
  - periphery-02: `standalone-server.md` now states plainly that `graphorin start` serves health/metrics/tokens/tickets/WS-SSE only and that the domain routes mount only when adapters are composed programmatically via `createServer({...})`.
  - periphery-03: the client SSE fallback survives reconnects - `#reconnect` no longer attempts the RPC resubscribe on the read-only SSE transport (which threw and permanently killed the subscription); the reconnect carries the subscription's cursor as a `Last-Event-ID` header so the server replays only missed events; a closed bound subscription is recreated on the next `subscribe()`.
  - periphery-08: the idempotency middleware tracks in-flight keyed executions - a concurrent duplicate gets `409 idempotency-in-flight` + `Retry-After` instead of double-executing (per draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header).
  - periphery-09: `subscribe({ target: 'run' })` without `sessionId` throws a clear client-side error instead of building a `run:` subject the server grammar can never accept.
  - periphery-10: session-stream subjects gate on `sessions:read:<sessionId>` (read-only streams, sessionId resource slot) instead of `agents:invoke:<sessionId>`, aligning with the SSE route's requirement.
  - periphery-11: interval triggers under `catchupPolicy: 'none'` advance to the next FUTURE boundary after downtime instead of firing immediately on restart; `recordActivity()` no longer arms idle timers on a stopped scheduler (P-14).
  - periphery-05: the TransformersJS embedder throws for an unknown model with no `dim` hint (the PS-11 fix ported from the Ollama embedder) instead of assuming 768 - a wrong assumed width baked a wrong-width id + vec0 table and the id changed after the first embed; a width drift against a bound dim now throws too.
  - P-05: the WS upgrade bearer verification passes the client IP so the per-IP failure lockout engages for upgrade attempts (previously a lockout-free brute-force surface).
  - Docs: the fictional "disconnect policy" section replaced with the real reconnect-and-replay behaviour; the WS ticket endpoint path corrected to `/v1/session/ws-ticket`.

First version published to the npm registry (with Sigstore build
provenance). The 0.2.0, 0.3.0, and 0.4.0 versions were internal lockstep
milestones and were never published. All `@graphorin/*` packages release
lockstep at the same version; the full release notes for 0.2.0-0.5.0 live

### Minor Changes

- Initial release. Background-task scheduler for the Graphorin
  framework - durable cron / interval / idle / event triggers, an
  in-tree 5-field cron parser, per-trigger catch-up policies, and a
  shared code path for library and server modes.
