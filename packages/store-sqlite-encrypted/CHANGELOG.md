### Patch Changes

- [#209](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/209) [`7991726`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/7991726fbd06426bdfb1e9c1a5c1e4bd5466d0f4) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - Public TSDoc no longer carries internal audit/work-item ticket ids ("deep retest P1-3", "W-135", wave letters, finding families): roughly 1100 docblock sites across 28 packages were rewritten to describe the behaviour itself, with every technical statement preserved (decision-record references like ADR-x/DEC-x stay). Two runtime strings also dropped their ticket ids: the tools executor's approval-rewrite refusal message and the server's secret-resolution hint. A new `check-api-wording` gate scans the generated API reference and fails CI if ticket vocabulary ever leaks back in.

### Minor Changes

- [#154](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/154) [`fe98522`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/fe98522ce2477c9a7dc09029f9dcfdb1f7c9aa04) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - W-012: `encryptDatabase({ swap: true })` now probes for a live writer BEFORE touching the source and refuses with the new typed `EncryptSwapLiveWriterError` when another connection holds the database. The swap path renames the source file; a running server would keep writing into the renamed `.bak.<ts>` inode, silently diverging from the encrypted copy until `storage cleanup-backups` deletes those writes. The probe (a journal-mode switch, which sqlite3mc refuses with "database is locked" under any other open connection) restores WAL in `finally`; the probe-to-rename window remains a documented best-effort residual. CLI `--swap` help and the storage guide now state the stopped-server requirement.

- [#154](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/154) [`fe98522`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/fe98522ce2477c9a7dc09029f9dcfdb1f7c9aa04) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - W-072: every export map's `import` condition becomes `default`, and the Node floor rises to `>=22.12.0`.

  CJS consumers previously hit a bewildering `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` instead of a clear ESM-only signal. With the `default` condition, plain `require('@graphorin/core')` works via Node's stable `require(esm)` - which shipped in 22.12, hence the engines bump across every workspace manifest (packages, examples, benchmarks, docs; enforced by the widened mvp-readiness sweep). No dual-instance hazard: there is no CJS build, `require()` returns the same ESM module instance. ESM consumers are unaffected (`default` serves both paths; `types` stays first). The pack gate now runs attw under the full `node16` profile (was `esm-only`) and adds a runtime `require(esm)` smoke against the packed tarballs. Installs on Node 22.0-22.11 with `engine-strict` will refuse - upgrade Node (see the migration guide).

### Patch Changes

- [#162](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/162) [`73b19ca`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/73b19caeda388bda628a48138cb7d70b1db839a3) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - Remove phantom workspace dependencies that no source file imports: agent no longer depends on provider and observability, mcp/workflow/server no longer depend on observability, sessions no longer depends on security (and its memory edge moves to devDependencies where the single test import lives), skills no longer depends on tools. Dead tsdown `external` entries for the removed edges are gone too, so a future import can no longer build as external without a declared dependency. Consumer install graphs shrink accordingly; a new repo-wide `check-phantom-deps` CI gate keeps the manifest graph honest from here on.

- [#164](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/164) [`764239b`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/764239b97e0e0202442e91272583f13adeb12d00) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - Tarballs now ship `src/` so the published `dist/**/*.d.ts.map` files actually work (W-136): the maps referenced `../src/*.ts` that the `files` whitelist excluded, so go-to-definition fell back into `.d.ts` and the shipped maps were dead weight. The pack gate gains a `map-integrity` leg: every source referenced by a shipped map must resolve inside the tarball (or be embedded via `sourcesContent`), with an anti-vacuous guard - a package whose tsdown config emits declaration maps must contain a non-zero number of `.d.ts.map` files, so a cache-restored dist that silently dropped maps fails the gate instead of passing vacuously. `mvp-readiness` now requires `src` in every publishable `files` array.

No behavioral change at the current version: the rendered strings are byte-identical. A release bump no longer edits source; the new `check-version-consistency` gate fails any reintroduced hardcoded framework version.

### Patch Changes

- [#135](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/135) [`4f850d9`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/4f850d9bc0a05d6256c59c5117b010336fcb41d3) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - Store durability and data lifecycle (audit 2026-07-04 Wave B, cluster B7).

  - store-02: new `graphorin storage backup <dest>` - online, consistent copy via the driver's page-level `backup()` API (safe under a live writer, preserves rowids so FTS5 mappings survive, encrypted stores produce an equally-encrypted copy). `deployment.md` stops recommending the non-existent `BACKUP TO` and explicitly warns against `VACUUM INTO`.
  - store-03: episode vector KNN gains the MRET-9 over-fetch loop facts already had (shared `widenKnn` helper) - a minority user's episodic recall is no longer starved to zero by a dominant user's vectors.
  - store-04: GDPR `purge()` scrubs the fact's text out of `memory_history` (both rows keyed to the id and value-matching rows - a SUPERSEDE row carries the new fact's text on the OLD id) inside the same transaction, keeping the event skeleton; new `SqliteMemoryStore.pruneHistory(olderThanMs)` retention API bounds the otherwise-unbounded table.
  - store-05: `encryptDatabase` copies via the driver's online backup API instead of checkpoint-close-then-copyFileSync - a concurrent writer can no longer commit WAL frames that silently miss the encrypted copy.
  - store-06: every write transaction now BEGINs IMMEDIATE, eliminating the SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT class on read-then-write transactions under server+CLI concurrency (busy_timeout waits instead).
  - store-07: `upsertState` builds its UPDATE from the supplied patch keys only (insert-if-absent + patch, in one immediate transaction) and `releaseLock` is a single conditional UPDATE - a concurrently acquired consolidator lock can no longer be silently reverted.
  - store-13: migration 025 adds partial indexes on `facts.supersedes` / `facts.superseded_by`, so `historyOf` chain walks stop scanning the user's facts per node; registry owner map backfilled for 024/025.
  - store F13: `distanceMetric: 'dot'` is coerced to `'cosine'` at registration with a loud warning (the vec0 table never computed dot; the meta now matches reality).

- [#138](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/138) [`6293a25`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/6293a2531c5c9265294da22fb365a08f2bdf445a) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - Documentation-truth sweep (audit 2026-07-04 Wave E, cluster E10): stale npm package descriptions rewritten (cli "Phase 14a three commands", mcp "upcoming auth CLI", store-sqlite's nonexistent WorkerPool), the store-sqlite WorkerPool TSDoc and the cipher-pragma ordering comment corrected, the executor timeout-precedence JSDoc fixed to the real `inlineToolTimeoutMs > tier timeoutMs > default` order, the `rrf.<label>` explain signals documented, and the skills spec-snapshot wording no longer claims a CI cron refreshes it (the diff is a manual `--upstream` pass; the release gate only parses the bundled snapshot).

First version published to the npm registry (with Sigstore build
provenance). The 0.2.0, 0.3.0, and 0.4.0 versions were internal lockstep
milestones and were never published. All `@graphorin/*` packages release
lockstep at the same version; the full release notes for 0.2.0-0.5.0 live
in the repository-level
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial release of the optional encryption-at-rest sub-pack for the Graphorin
  framework's default SQLite store. Pulls in
  `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers@^12.9.0` and exposes the `encryptDatabase`,
  `rekeyDatabase`, `cipherIntegrityCheck`, and `createEncryptedConnection`
  helpers consumed by the `graphorin storage` CLI.
