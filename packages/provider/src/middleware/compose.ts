 *
 * ## Why this order
 *
 * Composition is outermost-first, so a request flows top→bottom and a
 * response flows bottom→top:
 *
 * - `withTracing` is outermost so the span wraps everything below —
 *   including retries — and records true end-to-end latency.
 * - `withRetry` sits above the rate/cost limiters so each retry
 *   attempt is independently counted and throttled.
 * - `withRateLimit` → `withCostLimit` → `withCostTracking` form the
 *   budget stack: throttle before admitting, reject over-budget calls
 *   before spending, then meter what actually went through.
 * - `withFallback` is just above redaction so a fallback to a
 *   secondary provider still passes through the redactor.
 * - `withRedaction` is **innermost** (closest to the provider) so it
 *   is the last thing to touch the outbound payload and the first to
 *   touch the inbound stream — guaranteeing every retry, fallback, and
 *   cost-tracked request sees an already-redacted payload and no
 *   secret can bypass it.
 *
 * @stable
