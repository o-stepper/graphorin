### Patch Changes

- [#135](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/135) [`4f850d9`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/4f850d9bc0a05d6256c59c5117b010336fcb41d3) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - Store durability and data lifecycle (audit 2026-07-04 Wave B, cluster B7).

  - store-02: new `graphorin storage backup <dest>` - online, consistent copy via the driver's page-level `backup()` API (safe under a live writer, preserves rowids so FTS5 mappings survive, encrypted stores produce an equally-encrypted copy). `deployment.md` stops recommending the non-existent `BACKUP TO` and explicitly warns against `VACUUM INTO`.
  - store-03: episode vector KNN gains the MRET-9 over-fetch loop facts already had (shared `widenKnn` helper) - a minority user's episodic recall is no longer starved to zero by a dominant user's vectors.
  - store-04: GDPR `purge()` scrubs the fact's text out of `memory_history` (both rows keyed to the id and value-matching rows - a SUPERSEDE row carries the new fact's text on the OLD id) inside the same transaction, keeping the event skeleton; new `SqliteMemoryStore.pruneHistory(olderThanMs)` retention API bounds the otherwise-unbounded table.
  - store-05: `encryptDatabase` copies via the driver's online backup API instead of checkpoint-close-then-copyFileSync - a concurrent writer can no longer commit WAL frames that silently miss the encrypted copy.
  - store-06: every write transaction now BEGINs IMMEDIATE, eliminating the SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT class on read-then-write transactions under server+CLI concurrency (busy_timeout waits instead).
  - store-07: `upsertState` builds its UPDATE from the supplied patch keys only (insert-if-absent + patch, in one immediate transaction) and `releaseLock` is a single conditional UPDATE - a concurrently acquired consolidator lock can no longer be silently reverted.
  - store-13: migration 025 adds partial indexes on `facts.supersedes` / `facts.superseded_by`, so `historyOf` chain walks stop scanning the user's facts per node; registry owner map backfilled for 024/025.
  - store F13: `distanceMetric: 'dot'` is coerced to `'cosine'` at registration with a loud warning (the vec0 table never computed dot; the meta now matches reality).

- [#138](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/138) [`6293a25`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/6293a2531c5c9265294da22fb365a08f2bdf445a) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - Documentation-truth sweep (audit 2026-07-04 Wave E, cluster E10): stale npm package descriptions rewritten (cli "Phase 14a three commands", mcp "upcoming auth CLI", store-sqlite's nonexistent WorkerPool), the store-sqlite WorkerPool TSDoc and the cipher-pragma ordering comment corrected, the executor timeout-precedence JSDoc fixed to the real `inlineToolTimeoutMs > tier timeoutMs > default` order, the `rrf.<label>` explain signals documented, and the skills spec-snapshot wording no longer claims a CI cron refreshes it (the diff is a manual `--upstream` pass; the release gate only parses the bundled snapshot).

- [#138](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/pull/138) [`6293a25`](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/commit/6293a2531c5c9265294da22fb365a08f2bdf445a) Thanks [@o-stepper](https://github.com/o-stepper)! - Fix `graphorin storage cleanup-backups` being a silent no-op on Windows (audit 2026-07-04 Wave E, cluster E6): the DB base name was derived via `dbPath.split('/')`, which on backslash-separated Windows paths returned the whole path so no directory entry ever matched. Now uses `node:path` `basename`/`join`. Also documents the supported-platforms matrix (the one genuine ARM gap: `sqlite-vec` ships no `windows-arm64` binary, so vector search is unavailable on Windows-on-ARM while FTS recall keeps working).

## 0.5.0

First version published to the npm registry (with Sigstore build
provenance). The 0.2.0, 0.3.0, and 0.4.0 versions were internal lockstep
milestones and were never published. All `@graphorin/*` packages release
lockstep at the same version; the full release notes for 0.2.0-0.5.0 live
in the repository-level
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/o-stepper/graphorin/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## 0.1.0

Initial release. See the workspace root `CHANGELOG.md` for the full
release notes; the per-package changelog is generated by Changesets
and tracks subsequent updates.
