title: Standalone server
description: Promote your assistant to a daemon with REST + WebSocket + SSE fallback, durable triggers, replay, Prometheus metrics, and health checks.

# Standalone server

`@graphorin/server` is the optional standalone runtime. Same library packages, different lifetime — promote your assistant to a daemon with a network API the moment it has to outlive a single Node.js process.

::: tip Library mode is the default
You only need the standalone server when:
- your assistant has to **survive process restart**, OR
- you expose it over the network (browser, Slack bot, mobile app), OR
- you want **durable triggers** (cron, interval, idle, event).

For a CLI script or a desktop app, embed the library packages directly. See [Architecture § Two ways to ship](/guide/architecture#two-ways-to-ship).

## REST surface

Built on [`hono`](https://github.com/honojs/hono) (MIT) and [`@hono/node-server`](https://github.com/honojs/node-server) (MIT). The default `basePath` is `/v1`. Every authenticated endpoint requires a bearer token signed with HMAC-SHA256 against the deployment-wide pepper. The unauthenticated `/v1/health` route is exempt.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/v1/health` | Liveness + readiness summary (probes for storage, audit log, secrets, triggers, encryption). |
| `GET` | `/v1/health/secrets` | Authenticated drilldown of the active `SecretsStore`. |
| `GET` | `/v1/metrics` | Prometheus exposition (path configurable; auth optional). |
| `GET` | `/v1/agents` | List registered agents. |

| `POST` | `/v1/auth/session/ws-ticket` | Mint a single-use WebSocket session ticket. |

## WebSocket protocol

`@graphorin/protocol` ships the `graphorin.protocol.v1` contract — a typed message envelope for live event streaming over WebSocket. Built on [`@hono/node-ws`](https://github.com/honojs/middleware) (MIT).

```ts
import { GraphorinClient } from '@graphorin/client';

const client = new GraphorinClient({
  baseURL: 'wss://assistant.example.com',
  token: process.env.SERVER_TOKEN,
});

for await (const event of client.runAgent('planner', { prompt: 'Plan a hike.' })) {
  if (event.type === 'text.delta') process.stdout.write(event.delta);
}
```

The browser-friendly client is published as `@graphorin/client` and depends only on `@graphorin/protocol`. SSE is the documented fallback for environments that cannot upgrade to WebSocket.

## Triggers

`@graphorin/triggers` is the durable scheduling layer. Four trigger kinds:

| Kind | Spec |
|---|---|
| `cron` | Standard 5-field cron expression. |
| `interval` | Fixed interval in milliseconds. |
| `idle` | Fires after N ms of agent inactivity. |
| `event` | Listens on a named event channel. |

Declare a trigger using the four typed factories:

```ts
import { cron, interval, idle, event, createScheduler } from '@graphorin/triggers';

const morningSummary = cron(
  'morning-summary',
  '0 8 * * *',
  async () => {
    await agent.run('Send the morning summary.');
  },
);

const scheduler = createScheduler({ store: sqlite.triggers });
await scheduler.register(morningSummary);
await scheduler.start();
```

The triggers daemon (mounted by `@graphorin/server`) owns the schedule, persists the next-firing time across restarts, fires the registered callback, and audits every fire decision.

### Background consolidation

When you pass **both** a `consolidator` and a triggers scheduler to `createServer({ consolidator, triggers })`, the server bridges them in `beforeStart`: it registers the consolidator's `cron` / `idle` triggers with the scheduler so background distillation actually runs — no manual `registerConsolidatorTriggers` call. The default trigger set is `idle:5m` (drives the light + standard phases between sessions) plus a daily `cron:0 4 * * *` that makes the **deep** phase reachable — deep drains the deferred conflict-check queue and runs reflection, and only `cron` / `manual` / `budget` reasons schedule it. `turn` / `event` triggers are **consumer-emitted**: the scheduler can't fire them on its own, so your agent loop must call `consolidator.trigger({ kind: 'turn' | 'event' }, scope)` itself. The bridge uses the consolidator's `defaultScope`, so configure one; and remember the default `free` tier pins the budget to zero (set a paid tier for distillation to do anything — see [Memory system](/guide/memory-system#background-consolidator)).

## Idempotency

Repeated submissions with the same `Idempotency-Key` + body return the original response **for the same principal only** — the record is bound to the executing token, a different token gets `409 idempotency-conflict` (IP-6). `POST /v1/tokens` is excluded from response caching entirely (it returns a raw secret), so repeated mint calls re-execute.

## Disconnect policy

Long-running streams (agent runs, workflows) survive client disconnects through the configurable `disconnect.policy`:

| Policy | Behaviour on client disconnect |
|---|---|
| `'continue'` (default) | Run continues; client reconnects via `GET /v1/agents/:id/runs/:runId/follow`. |
| `'pause'` | Run is paused; resumed when the client reconnects with the same `runId`. |
| `'abort'` | Run aborts with `client-disconnected`. |

## Health checks

`GET /v1/health` returns:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "checks": {
    "storage": "ok",
    "audit-log": "ok",
    "secrets": "ok",
    "triggers": "ok",
    "providers": { "openai": "ok", "ollama": "unreachable" }
  }
}
```

Provider checks are passive — the server never opens an outbound connection it doesn't already have.

## Prometheus metrics

`GET /metrics` exposes the counters from [Observability](/guide/observability#counters) in Prometheus exposition format, plus the standard process / Node.js metrics.

## Configuration

```toml
# graphorin.config.toml
[server]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 8787

[storage]
path = "./assistant.db"
encryption-at-rest = "keyring:graphorin_db_key?service=graphorin"

[secrets]
backend = "keychain"

[triggers]
enabled = true

[observability]
exporter = "otlp"
otlp-url = "https://otel.example.com/v1/traces"
```

The CLI command `graphorin start --config graphorin.config.toml` boots the server.

## Process model

Recommended deployment patterns:

- **systemd**: ship the unit template the project provides under `examples/systemd/`.
- **Docker**: ship the image template under `examples/docker/`.
- **Kubernetes**: ship the manifests under `examples/k8s/`.

All three templates run Graphorin as a **non-root** user with the audit log on its own mountpoint and the secrets store unreadable by the application's main filesystem path.

## Next steps

- [CLI](/guide/cli) — `graphorin start`, `graphorin doctor`, `graphorin token`.
- [Deployment](/guide/deployment) — production checklists.
- [Security](/guide/security) — server-token authentication, audit log.
- [Observability](/guide/observability) — what gets traced.
